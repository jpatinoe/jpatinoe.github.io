## Projects

### Current Work
I am currently working on my **PhD thesis** titled *"Transitions to Wild Chaos in a Four-Dimensional Lorenz-like System"* at the *University of Auckland*. This research explores the intricate dynamics and chaos in higher-dimensional systems given by a system of differential equations. You can check my posters [here](https://auckland.figshare.com/authors/Juan_Patino_Echeverria/12040190), they show some reults of my research.

You can also check out my 3-Minute Thesis Competition video below:

### Previous Research
- **Summer Research Scholarship**, *Victoria University of Wellington*  
  Collaborated with [Brendan Harding](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/brendan.harding/publications) in **Fluid Dynamics**, focusing on understanding **bifurcation phenomena** in inertial particle focusing in fluid flow through spiral ducts: dynamics, and particle separation.

- **Honours Degree Final Project**, *Victoria University of Wellington*  
  Worked under the supervision of [Mark McGuinness](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/mark.mcguinness) on a project investigating **synchronisation phenomena** in coupled oscillators.

### Additional Projects
Prior to my mathematics research, I developed and coordinated an online teaching project called **Ingooz**, aimed at helping university students connect with qualified tutors from across Latin America.
