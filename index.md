Hello! Welcome to my website.

I'm Juan Patino-Echeverria, a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. I'm currently working on my thesis titled **"Transitions to Wild Chaos in a Four-Dimensional Lorenz-like System"** under the supervision of Professors [Hinke Osinga](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~hinke/) and [Bernd Krauskopf](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~berndk/). My research is supported by a University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship. My research field is the broad area of dynamical systems, particularly in exploring higher-dimensional forms of chaos in vector fields. I am interested in nonlinear dynamics, bifurcation theory, and numerical continuation, which are the cornerstones of my work.

I primarily use AUTO, MATLAB, and Julia for my computational work. While I'm deeply interested in coding, I wouldn't call myself an expert—yet. However, I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills. In addition to my research, I also work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Auckland, where I enjoy helping students navigate the beauty of mathematics.

When not immersed in mathematics, I am passionate about sports, particularly triathlon and open-water swimming. Music is another big part of my life, and I have a habit of making lists that I fully intend to complete one day!
